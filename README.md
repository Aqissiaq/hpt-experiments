# Repository for Agda code associated with my master thesis (UiB 2021/22)

 - [hpt-formalization](./hpt-formalization) contains formalizations of Angiuli et al.'s [homotopical patch theory](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~cangiuli/papers/hpt-expanded.pdf) in Cubical Agda including:
   - [4. An elementary patch theory](./hpt-formalization/elementary-hpt.agda)
   - [5. A patch theory with laws](./hpt-formalization/laws-hpt-noTrunc-noIndep.agda) (and in particular the "program and prove" approach of 5.3)
   - [6. A patch theory with richer contexts](./hpt-formalization/richer-no-laws.agda) (without laws, an incomplete version with patch laws [here](./hpt-formalization/richer.agda))
 - [experiments](./experiments) contains various attempts at different formulations of version control systems as HITs
 - [trash-can](./trash-can) contains more attempts, but once I am even less happy with
